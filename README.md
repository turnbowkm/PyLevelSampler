# PyLevelSampler
The PyLevelSampler is a MicroPython controlled apparatus for sampling liquid based on relative height of fluid. The apparatus utilizes a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico 2, Arduino Uno R3, ESP32) to log stage readings, from a fuel sender, to a SD card. The apparatus is made of 4 inch PVC pipe that houses the level sensor, a 12V diaphragm pump, sample storage bottle, the microcontroller and associated power sources/ electrical components. The pump moves water from the base of the sampler into a sample bottle after the level exceeds a threshold.
